# Natural-Language-Processing
This repository contains project work for the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Course. This course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical skills in NLP, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to analyze, interpret, and generate human language using computational methods.

## Course Topics
- Lexical, syntactic, and semantic elements of language
- Statistical properties of language
- Rule-based and data-driven approaches to language analysis
- Introduction to neural networks and deep learning for NLP
- Applications to real-world problems

## Hands-On Projects 
This course includes a variety of hands-on labs and programming assignments, designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts through practical implementation. The projects covered in this course are:
- **Chatbots**: Building conversational agents
- **Sentence Generation**: Creating algorithms to generate human-like text
- **Text Summarization**: Developing models to summarize long documents
- **Information Extraction**: Extracting structured information from unstructured text
- **De-Identification**: Anonymizing sensitive information in text
- **Information Retrieval**: Implementing systems to retrieve relevant information
- **Question Answering**: Designing systems to answer questions based on text input
- **Sentiment Analysis and Classification**: Analyzing and classifying the sentiment of text
- **Building Neural Networks with PyTorch**: Implementing and training neural networks for various NLP tasks.
