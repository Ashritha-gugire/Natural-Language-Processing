    "The regular expressions used are:\n",

    "1. -(Hello|Hi|Hey) : Matches various forms of greetings from the user.\n",
    "2. -university: Matches user mentions of the term \"university\".\n",
    "3. -student : Matches queries related to being a student or applying for degrees.\n",
    "4. -(study|course|classes|subject): Matches user queries related to studies.\n",
    "5. -(admission|query|status|documents): Matches queries related to admissions or status.\n",

    "9. -want : Matches user expressions of desires or intentions.\n",
    "10. -will : Matches user expressions of plans or intentions.\n",
    "11. -yes/no: Matches user affirmations.\n",
    "12. -(thanks|thank you) : Matches expressions of gratitude from the user.\n",
