    "Our chatbot typically is designed to facilitate a conversational interface, particulary for assisting student or prospective students interacting with a bot representing George Mason University. \n",
    "Mr.Bot aims to respond appropriately to various user inputs, guiding them through common queries related to admissions, courses status inquiries and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. User's input triggers different responses from the bot based on predefined patterns\n",
    "2. The dictionary consists of regular expressions as keys and lists of corresponding responses as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "key is a regular expression which is used for word spotting. Value is the possible answer.\n",
    "If a match has been found by using the regular expression, Eliza Mr.Bot will randomly choose an answer from the dictionary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The regular expressions used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. -(Hello|Hi|Hey) : Matches various forms of greetings from the user.\n",
    "2. -university: Matches user mentions of the term \"university\".\n",
    "3. -student : Matches queries related to being a student or applying for degrees.\n",
    "4. -(study|course|classes|subject): Matches user queries related to studies.\n",
    "5. -(admission|query|status|documents): Matches queries related to admissions or status.\n",
    "6. -graduate: Matches queries related to graduate studies.\n",
    "7. -undergraduate: Matches queries related to undergraduate studies.\n",
    "8. -(international|citizen) : Matches queries related to international students.\n",
    "9. -want : Matches user expressions of desires or intentions.\n",
    "10. -will : Matches user expressions of plans or intentions.\n",
    "11. -yes/no: Matches user affirmations.\n",
    "12. -(thanks|thank you) : Matches expressions of gratitude from the user.\n",
    "13. others: Default regular expression that matches any input if none of the above patterns match.\n",
